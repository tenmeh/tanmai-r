# Live game tracking: turn a stream of imperfect screenshots into a game.
#
# Recognition is imperfect and a screen capture is noisy: it delivers
# re-renders, half-finished piece animations, hover highlights and the
# occasional misread square. Accepting whatever FEN comes back would produce a
# "game" that is mostly garbage.
#
# So nothing is accepted on the strength of recognition alone. A new
# observation is only believed when it can be *explained*: when there is
# exactly one sequence of legal moves, of at most a couple of plies, that turns
# the position we are already sure about into the one we just saw. That single
# rule does the work of a dozen ad-hoc filters - it rejects noise, tolerates a
# frame arriving mid-animation, survives a dropped frame, and gets castling,
# en passant and promotion right for free because chess.js generates the moves.

#' Decide what a freshly recognized position means for a tracked game

#' * `invalid` - the recognizer produced nothing usable.
#' * `unchanged` - the same position we already hold; the common case, and not
#'   an error.
#' * `stale` - a position we were in earlier. A capture frame caught mid
#'   animation, or a re-render, shows the board as it was; treating that as a
#'   fresh event would rewind the game.
#' * `move` - exactly one legal sequence explains it. Accepted.
#' * `ambiguous` - several sequences explain it, so we cannot say which was
#'   played. Rare in practice but never guessed at.
#' * `unexplained` - no legal sequence reaches it. Almost always a misread
#'   square; occasionally a jump longer than `max_plies`. Rejected either way.
