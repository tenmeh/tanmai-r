# Reading a game never needs an engine; understanding one does. Everything here
# is therefore optional at every level: the package installs without Stockfish,
# loads without it, and reads positions and games without it. Only these
# functions require it, and they say so plainly rather than failing obscurely.
#
# One call per *position*, not two per move. `engine_session_eval()` returns the
# evaluation and the best move together, and the position after move i is the
# position before move i+1, so a game of n moves costs n+1 searches rather than
# the 2n a naive "score the move, then score the alternative" loop would use.

# Checkmate, on the same scale the engine uses for its own mate scores, so a
# mate outranks any amount of material. Negative for the side to move: the
# player with no legal reply is the one who has lost.
